# 0x0C. C - More malloc, free

#### Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free

Resources

Read or watch:

Do I cast the result of malloc?
man or help:

exit (3)

calloc

realloc


# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
How to use the exit function

What are the functions calloc and realloc from the standard library and how to use them

### Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.

You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.

You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
### General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do 
we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file


# Tasks
## 0. Trust no one
*mandatory*

Write a function that allocates memory using malloc.

**Prototype:** void *malloc_checked(unsigned int b);

Returns a pointer to the allocated memory

if malloc fails, the malloc_checked function should cause normal process termination with a status value of 98


   
## 1. string_nconcat
*mandatory*

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

**Prototype:** char *string_nconcat(char *s1, char *s2, unsigned int n);

The returned pointer shall point to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains s1, followed by the first n bytes of s2, and null terminated

If the function fails, it should return NULL

If n is greater or equal to the length of s2 then use the entire string s2

if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string


   
## 2. _calloc
*mandatory*

Write a function that allocates memory for an array, using malloc.

**Prototype:** void *_calloc(unsigned int nmemb, unsigned int size);

The _calloc function allocates memory for an array of nmemb elements of size bytes each and returns a pointer to the allocated memory.

The memory is set to zero

If nmemb or size is 0, then _calloc returns NULL

If malloc fails, then _calloc returns NULL

FYI: The standard library provides a different function: calloc. Run man calloc to learn more.


    
## 3. array_range
*mandatory*

Write a function that creates an array of integers.

**Prototype:** int *array_range(int min, int max);

The array created should contain all the values from min (included) to max (included), ordered from min to max

Return: the pointer to the newly created array

If min > max, return NULL

If malloc fails, return NULL


## 4. _realloc
*#advanced*

Write a function that reallocates a memory block using malloc and free

**Prototype:** void *_realloc(void *ptr, unsigned int old_size, unsigned int new_size);

where ptr is a pointer to the memory previously allocated with a call to malloc: malloc(old_size)

old_size is the size, in bytes, of the allocated space for ptr

and new_size is the new size, in bytes of the new memory block

The contents will be copied to the newly allocated space, in the range from the start of ptr up to the minimum of the old and new sizes

If new_size > old_size, the “added” memory should not be initialized

If new_size == old_size do not do anything and return ptr

If ptr is NULL, then the call is equivalent to malloc(new_size), for all values of old_size and new_size

If new_size is equal to zero, and ptr is not NULL, then the call is equivalent to free(ptr). Return NULL

Don’t forget to free ptr when it makes sense

FYI: The standard library provides a different function: realloc. Run man realloc to learn more.


## 5. We must accept finite disappointment, but never lose infinite hope
*#advanced*

Write a program that multiplies two positive numbers.

**Usage:** mul num1 num2

num1 and num2 will be passed in base 10

Print the result, followed by a new line

If the number of arguments is incorrect, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of 98

num1 and num2 should only be composed of digits. If not, print Error, followed by a new line, and exit with a status of 98

You are allowed to use more than 5 functions in your file

You can use bc (man bc) to check your results.
