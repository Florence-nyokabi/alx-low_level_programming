 By Julien Barbier
 Weight: 1
 Project over - took place from Apr 4, 2022 to Apr 6, 2022 -
 
#### Concepts
For this project, we expect you to look at this concept:

Automatic and dynamic allocation, malloc and free

Resources

Read or watch:

0x0a - malloc & free - quick overview.pdf

Dynamic memory allocation in C - malloc calloc realloc free (stop at 6:50)

man or help:

malloc

free

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
What is the difference between automatic and dynamic allocation

What is malloc and free and how to use them

Why and when use malloc


How to use valgrind to check for memory leak

# Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.

You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.

You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

### Requirements
## General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc and free. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do 

we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

## More Info
You do not have to learn about calloc and realloc.


# Tasks
## 0. Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee

mandatory

Write a function that creates an array of chars, and initializes it with a specific char.

Prototype: char *create_array(unsigned int size, char c);


## 1. The woman who has no imagination has no wings

mandatory

Write a function that returns a pointer to a newly allocated space in memory, which contains a copy of the string given as a parameter.

Prototype: char *_strdup(char *str);

The _strdup() function returns a pointer to a new string which is a duplicate of the string str. Memory for the new string is obtained with malloc, and can be freed with free.

Returns NULL if str = NULL

On success, the _strdup function returns a pointer to the duplicated string. It returns NULL if insufficient memory was available

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strdup. Run man strdup to learn more.


## 2. He who is not courageous enough to take risks will accomplish nothing in life

mandatory

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *str_concat(char *s1, char *s2);

The returned pointer should point to a newly allocated space in memory which contains the contents of s1, followed by the contents of s2, and null terminated

if NULL is passed, treat it as an empty string

The function should return NULL on failure


     
## 3. If you even dream of beating me you'd better wake up and apologize

mandatory

Write a function that returns a pointer to a 2 dimensional array of integers.

Prototype: int **alloc_grid(int width, int height);

Each element of the grid should be initialized to 0

The function should return NULL on failure

If width or height is 0 or negative, return NULL


     
## 4. It's not bragging if you can back it up
mandatory

Write a function that frees a 2 dimensional grid previously created by your alloc_grid function.

Prototype: void free_grid(int **grid, int height);

Note that we will compile with your alloc_grid.c file. Make sure it compiles.



## 5. It isn't the mountains ahead to climb that wear you out; it's the pebble in your shoe

#advanced

Write a function that concatenates all the arguments of your program.

Prototype: char *argstostr(int ac, char **av);

Returns NULL if ac == 0 or av == NULL

Returns a pointer to a new string, or NULL if it fails

Each argument should be followed by a \n in the new string



     
## 6. I will show you how great I am

#advanced

Write a function that splits a string into words.

Prototype: char **strtow(char *str);

The function returns a pointer to an array of strings (words)

Each element of this array should contain a single word, null-terminated

The last element of the returned array should be NULL

Words are separated by spaces

Returns NULL if str == NULL or str == ""

If your function fails, it should return NULL
