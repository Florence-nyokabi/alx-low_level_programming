how to compile with unused variables
Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

## General
How to use arguments passed to your program
What are two prototypes of main that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
How to use __attribute__((unused)) or (void) to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

## Requirements
### General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h
Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
You are allowed to use the standard library

# Tasks
## 0. It ain't what they call you, it's what you answer to

Write a program that prints its name, followed by a new line.

If you rename the program, it will print the new name, without having to compile it again
You should not remove the path before the name of the program

## 1. Silence is argument carried out by other means

Write a program that prints the number of arguments passed into it.

Your program should print a number, followed by a new line

## 2. The best argument against democracy is a five-minute conversation with the average voter

Write a program that prints all arguments it receives.

All arguments should be printed, including the first one
Only print one argument per line, ending with a new line

## 3. Neither irony nor sarcasm is argument

Write a program that multiplies two numbers.

Your program should print the result of the multiplication, followed by a new line
You can assume that the two numbers and result of the multiplication can be stored in an integer
If the program does not receive two arguments, your program should print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1

## 4. To infinity and beyond

Write a program that adds positive numbers.

Print the result, followed by a new line
If no number is passed to the program, print 0, followed by a new line
If one of the number contains symbols that are not digits, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
You can assume that numbers and the addition of all the numbers can be stored in an int

## 5. Minimal Number of Coins for Change

Write a program that prints the minimum number of coins to make change for an amount of money.

**Usage**: ./change cents
where cents is the amount of cents you need to give back
if the number of arguments passed to your program is not exactly 1, print Error, followed by a new line, and return 1
you should use atoi to parse the parameter passed to your program
If the number passed as the argument is negative, print 0, followed by a new line
You can use an unlimited number of coins of values 25, 10, 5, 2, and 1 cent
