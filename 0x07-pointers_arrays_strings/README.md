# 0x07. C - Even more pointers, arrays and strings

## Requirements

### General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

### More Info
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, arrays of structures, malloc and free - yet.



# Tasks
## 1. memcpy

Write a function that copies memory area.

Prototype: char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);
The _memcpy() function copies n bytes from memory area src to memory area dest
Returns a pointer to dest
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memcpy. Run man memcpy to learn more.

## 2. strchr

Write a function that locates a character in a string.

Prototype: char *_strchr(char *s, char c);
Returns a pointer to the first occurrence of the character c in the string s, or NULL if the character is not found
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strchr. Run man strchr to learn more.

## 3. strspn

Write a function that gets the length of a prefix substring.

Prototype: unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);
Returns the number of bytes in the initial segment of s which consist only of bytes from accept
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strspn. Run man strspn to learn more.

## 4. strpbrk

Write a function that searches a string for any of a set of bytes.

Prototype: char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);
The _strpbrk() function locates the first occurrence in the string s of any of the bytes in the string accept
Returns a pointer to the byte in s that matches one of the bytes in accept, or NULL if no such byte is found
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strpbrk. Run man strpbrk to learn more.

## 5. strstr

Write a function that locates a substring.

Prototype: char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);
The _strstr() function finds the first occurrence of the substring needle in the string haystack. The terminating null bytes (\0) are not compared
Returns a pointer to the beginning of the located substring, or NULL if the substring is not found.
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strstr. Run man strstr to learn more.

## 6. Chess is mental torture

Write a function that prints the chessboard.

Prototype: void print_chessboard(char (*a)[8]);

## 7. The line of life is a ragged diagonal between duty and desire

Write a function that prints the sum of the two diagonals of a square matrix of integers.

Prototype: void print_diagsums(int *a, int size);
Format: see example
You are allowed to use the standard library
Note that in the following example we are casting an int[][] into an int*. This is not something you should do. The goal here is to make sure you understand how an array of array is stored in memory.

## 8. Double pointer, double fun

Write a function that sets the value of a pointer to a char.

Prototype: void set_string(char **s, char *to);

Tasks
0. memset
mandatory
Score: 0% (Checks completed: 0%)
Write a function that fills memory with a constant byte.

Prototype: char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);
The _memset() function fills the first n bytes of the memory area pointed to by s with the constant byte b
Returns a pointer to the memory area s
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: memset. Run man memset to learn more.
