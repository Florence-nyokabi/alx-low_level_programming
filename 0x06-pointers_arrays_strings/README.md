# 0x06. C - More pointers, arrays and strings

# Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

# General
What are pointers and how to use them

What are arrays and how to use them

What are the differences between pointers and arrays

How to use strings and how to manipulate them

Scope of variables

### Copyright - Plagiarism
You are tasked to come up with solutions for the tasks below yourself to meet with the above learning objectives.

You will not be able to meet the objectives of this or any following project by copying and pasting someone else’s work.

You are not allowed to publish any content of this project.

Any form of plagiarism is strictly forbidden and will result in removal from the program.

## Requirements
### General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do 
we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

# Tasks
## 0. strcat

Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);

This function appends the src string to the dest string, overwriting the terminating null byte (\0) at the end of dest, and then adds a terminating null byte

Returns a pointer to the resulting string dest

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcat. Run man strcat to learn more.


## 1. strncat
Write a function that concatenates two strings.

Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);

The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that

it will use at most n bytes from src; and

src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes

Return a pointer to the resulting string dest

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncat. Run man strncat to learn more.
    

## 2. strncpy

Write a function that copies a string.

Prototype: char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);

Your function should work exactly like strncpy

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strncpy. Run man strncpy to learn more.

    
## 3. strcmp

Write a function that compares two strings.

Prototype: int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);

Your function should work exactly like strcmp

FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: strcmp. Run man strcmp to learn more.

    
## 4. I am a kind of paranoid in reverse. I suspect people of plotting to make me happy

Write a function that reverses the content of an array of integers.

Prototype: void reverse_array(int *a, int n);

Where n is the number of elements of the array

## 5. Always look up

Write a function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase.

Prototype: char *string_toupper(char *);

    
## 6. Expect the best. Prepare for the worst. Capitalize on what comes

Write a function that capitalizes all words of a string.

Prototype: char *cap_string(char *);

Separators of words: space, tabulation, new line, ,, ;, ., !, ?, ", (, ), {, and }

    
## 7. Mozart composed his music not for the elite, but for everybody

Write a function that encodes a string into 1337.

Letters a and A should be replaced by 4

Letters e and E should be replaced by 3

Letters o and O should be replaced by 0

Letters t and T should be replaced by 7

Letters l and L should be replaced by 1

Prototype: char *leet(char *);

You can only use one if in your code

You can only use two loops in your code

You are not allowed to use switch

You are not allowed to use any ternary operation

    
## 8. rot13

Write a function that encodes a string using rot13.

Prototype: char *rot13(char *);

You can only use if statement once in your code

You can only use two loops in your code

You are not allowed to use switch

You are not allowed to use any ternary operation

## 9. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper

Write a function that prints an integer.

Prototype: void print_number(int n);

You can only use _putchar function to print

You are not allowed to use long

You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers

You are not allowed to hard-code special values

     
## 10. A dream doesn't become reality through magic; it takes sweat, determination and hard work

Add one line to this code, so that the program prints a[2] = 98, followed by a new line.

You are not allowed to use the variable a in your new line of code

You are not allowed to modify the variable p

You can only write one statement

You are not allowed to use ,

You are not allowed to code anything else than the line of expected line of code at the expected line

Your code should be written at line 19, before the ;

Do not remove anything from the initial code (not even the comments)

and don’t change anything but the line of code you are adding (don’t change the spaces to tabs!)

You are allowed to use the standard library

     
## 11. It is the addition of strangeness to beauty that constitutes the romantic character in art

Write a function that adds two numbers.

Prototype: char *infinite_add(char *n1, char *n2, char *r, int size_r);

Where n1 and n2 are the two numbers

r is the buffer that the function will use to store the result

size_r is the buffer size

The function returns a pointer to the result

You can assume that you will always get positive numbers, or 0

You can assume that there will be only digits in the strings n1 and n2

n1 and n2 will never be empty

If the result can not be stored in r the function must return 0

     
## 12. Noise is a buffer, more effective than cubicles or booth walls

Write a function that prints a buffer.

Prototype: void print_buffer(char *b, int size);

The function must print the content of size bytes of the buffer pointed by b

The output should print 10 bytes per line

Each line starts with the position of the first byte of the line in hexadecimal (8 chars), starting with 0

Each line shows the hexadecimal content (2 chars) of the buffer, 2 bytes at a time, separated by a space

Each line shows the content of the buffer. If the byte is a printable character, print the letter, if not, print .

Each line ends with a new line \n

If size is 0 or less, the output should be a new line only \n

You are allowed to use the standard library
