# 0x18-dynamic_libraries
## Requirements
### C
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file

## Bash
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS

All your files should end with a new line (why?)

The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, describing what each script is doing

All your files must be executable


# Tasks
## 0. A library is not a luxury but one of the necessities of life

Create the dynamic library libdynamic.so containing all the functions listed below:

int _putchar(char c);

int _islower(int c);

int _isalpha(int c);

int _abs(int n);

int _isupper(int c);

int _isdigit(int c);

int _strlen(char *s);

void _puts(char *s);

char *_strcpy(char *dest, char *src);

int _atoi(char *s);

char *_strcat(char *dest, char *src);

char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);

char *_strncpy(char *dest, char *src, int n);

int _strcmp(char *s1, char *s2);

char *_memset(char *s, char b, unsigned int n);

char *_memcpy(char *dest, char *src, unsigned int n);

char *_strchr(char *s, char c);

unsigned int _strspn(char *s, char *accept);

char *_strpbrk(char *s, char *accept);

char *_strstr(char *haystack, char *needle);

If you haven’t coded all of the above functions create empty ones, with the right prototype.
Don’t forget to push your main.h file in your repository, containing at least all the prototypes of the above functions.

## 1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future

Create a script that creates a dynamic library called liball.so from all the .c files that are in the current directory.

## 2. Let's call C functions from Python

I know, you’re missing C when coding in Python. So let’s fix that!

Create a dynamic library that contains C functions that can be called from Python.

## 3. Code injection: Win the Giga Millions!



I bought a ticket for the Giga Millions and chose these numbers: 9, 8, 10, 24, 75 + 9. If you could run two commands on the same server where the Giga Millions 

program runs, could you make me win the Jackpot?

Our mole got us a copy of the program, you can download it here. Our mole also gave us a piece of documentation:

 /* Giga Millions program                                                                                    
  * Players may pick six numbers from two separate pools of numbers:                                                
  * - five different numbers from 1 to 75 and                                                                       
  * - one number from 1 to 15                                                                                       
  * You win the jackpot by matching all six winning numbers in a drawing.                                           
  * Your chances to win the jackpot is 1 in 258,890,850                                                             
  *                                                                                                                 
  * usage: ./gm n1 n2 n3 n4 n5 bonus
  
You can’t modify the program gm itself as Master Sysadmin Sylvain (MSS) always checks its MD5 before running it

The system is an Linux Ubuntu 16.04

The server has internet access

Our mole will be only able to run two commands from a shell script, without being detected by MSS

Your shell script should be maximum 3 lines long. You are not allowed to use ;, &&, ||, |, (it would be detected by MSS), and have a maximum of two commands

Our mole has only the authorization to upload one file on the server. It will be your shell script

Our mole will run your shell script this way: mss@gm_server$ . ./101-make_me_win.sh

Our mole will run your shell script from the same directory containing the program gm, exactly 98 seconds before MSS runs gm with my numbers: ./gm 9 8 10 24 75 9

MSS will use the same terminal and session than our mole

Before running the gm program, MSS always check the content of the directory

MSS always exit after running the program gm

TL;DR; This is what is going to happen
