# 0x04. C - More functions, more nested loops

# Requirements
## General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs

All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89

All your files should end with a new line

A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory

Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl

You are not allowed to use global variables

No more than 5 functions per file

You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like printf, puts, etc… is forbidden

You are allowed to use _putchar

You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account

In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples

The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called main.h

Don’t forget to push your header file


# More Info
You do not have to understand the call by reference (address), stack, static variables, recursions or arrays, yet.


# Tasks
## 0. isupper

Write a function that checks for uppercase character.

Prototype: int _isupper(int c);
Returns 1 if c is uppercase
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isupper. Run man isupper to learn more.

    
## 1. isdigit

Write a function that checks for a digit (0 through 9).

Prototype: int _isdigit(int c);
Returns 1 if c is a digit
Returns 0 otherwise
FYI: The standard library provides a similar function: isdigit. Run man isdigit to learn more.

    
## 2. Collaboration is multiplication

Write a function that multiplies two integers.

Prototype: int mul(int a, int b);

    
## 3. The numbers speak for themselves

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

    
## 4. I believe in numbers and signs

Write a function that prints the numbers, from 0 to 9, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_most_numbers(void);
Do not print 2 and 4
You can only use _putchar twice in your code

## 5. Numbers constitute the only universal language

Write a function that prints 10 times the numbers, from 0 to 14, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void more_numbers(void);
You can only use _putchar three times in your code

    
## 6. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line

Write a function that draws a straight line in the terminal.

Prototype: void print_line(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character _ should be printed
The line should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print \n

    
## 7. I feel like I am diagonally parked in a parallel universe

Write a function that draws a diagonal line on the terminal.

Prototype: void print_diagonal(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where n is the number of times the character \ should be printed
The diagonal should end with a \n
If n is 0 or less, the function should only print a \n

    
## 8. You are so much sunshine in every square inch

Write a function that prints a square, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_square(int size);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where size is the size of the square
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the square

    
## 9. Fizz-Buzz

The “Fizz-Buzz test” is an interview question designed to help filter out the 99.5% of programming job candidates who can’t seem to program their way out of a wet paper bag.

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100, followed by a new line. But for multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for the multiples of five print Buzz. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.

Each number or word should be separated by a space
You are allowed to use the standard library

    
## 10. Triangles

Write a function that prints a triangle, followed by a new line.

Prototype: void print_triangle(int size);
You can only use _putchar function to print
Where size is the size of the triangle
If size is 0 or less, the function should print only a new line
Use the character # to print the triangle


    
## 11. The problem of distinguishing prime numbers from composite numbers and of resolving the latter into their prime factors is known to be one of the most important and useful in arithmetic

The prime factors of 1231952 are 2, 2, 2, 2, 37 and 2081.

Write a program that finds and prints the largest prime factor of the number 612852475143, followed by a new line.

You are allowed to use the standard library
Your program will be compiled with this command: gcc -Wall -pedantic -Werror -Wextra -std=gnu89 100-prime_factor.c -o 100-prime_factor -lm

    
## 12. Numbers have life; they're not just symbols on paper


Write a function that prints an integer.

Prototype: void print_number(int n);
You can only use _putchar function to print
You are not allowed to use long
You are not allowed to use arrays or pointers
You are not allowed to hard-code special values
