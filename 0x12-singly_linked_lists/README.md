0x12. C - Singly linked lists

Requirements
General
Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
All your files should end with a new line
A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project is mandatory
Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
You are not allowed to use global variables
No more than 5 functions per file
The only C standard library functions allowed are malloc, free and exit. Any use of functions like printf, puts, calloc, realloc etc… is forbidden
You are allowed to use _putchar
You don’t have to push _putchar.c, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function _putchar should be included in your header file called lists.h
Don’t forget to push your header file
All your header files should be include guarded
More Info
Please use this data structure for this project:

/**
 * struct list_s - singly linked list
 * @str: string - (malloc'ed string)
 * @len: length of the string
 * @next: points to the next node
 *
 * Description: singly linked list node structure
 */
typedef struct list_s
{
    char *str;
    unsigned int len;
    struct list_s *next;
} list_t;


0. Print list
mandatory
Write a function that prints all the elements of a list_t list.

Prototype: size_t print_list(const list_t *h);
Return: the number of nodes
Format: see example
If str is NULL, print [0] (nil)
You are allowed to use printf

1. List length
mandatory
Write a function that returns the number of elements in a linked list_t list.

Prototype: size_t list_len(const list_t *h);


2. Add node
mandatory
Write a function that adds a new node at the beginning of a list_t list.

Prototype: list_t *add_node(list_t **head, const char *str);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
str needs to be duplicated
You are allowed to use strdup


3. Add node at the end
mandatory
Write a function that adds a new node at the end of a list_t list.

Prototype: list_t *add_node_end(list_t **head, const char *str);
Return: the address of the new element, or NULL if it failed
str needs to be duplicated
You are allowed to use strdup


4. Free list
mandatory
Write a function that frees a list_t list.

Prototype: void free_list(list_t *head);


5. The Hare and the Tortoise
#advanced


Write a function that prints You're beat! and yet, you must allow,\nI bore my house upon my back!\n before the main function is executed.

You are allowed to use the printf function


6. Real programmers can write assembly code in any language
#advanced
Write a 64-bit program in assembly that prints Hello, Holberton, followed by a new line.

You are only allowed to use the printf function
You are not allowed to use interrupts
Your program will be compiled using nasm and gcc:
